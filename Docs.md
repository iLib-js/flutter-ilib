|_\<int?>_ month | The month|
|_\<int?>_ day | The day of the month|

|_\<int?>_ second | The second [0..59]|
|_\<int?>_ millisecond | The millisecond [0..999]|
|_\<int?>_ unixtime | Sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time.<br>Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970.|
|_\<String?>_ timezone | Time zone name as a string|
|_\<String?>_ type | Specifies the type/calendar of the date desired. <br>The list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are defined. i.e. "gregorian", "ethiopic", "thaisolar", "persian" etc. <br> This property may also be given as "calendar" instead of "type".|
|_\<String?>_ calendar | Same as "type" property |
|_\<DateTime?>_ dateTime |[DateTime](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime-class.html) class of flutter|

## ILibDateFmtOptions

### Properties
|name|description|
|------|---|
|_\<String?>_ locale| Locale to use when formatting the date/time |
|_\<String?>_ type| Specifies whether this formatter should format times only, dates only, or both times and dates together. Valid values are "time", "date", and "datetime". <br> Note that in some locales, the standard format uses the order "time followed by date" and in others, the order is exactly opposite,<br> so it is better to create a single "datetime" formatter than it is to create a time formatter and a date formatter separately and concatenate the results. <br> A "datetime" formatter will get the order correct for the locale.<br> The default type if none is specified in with the type option is "date".|
|_\<String?>_ length| Specifies the length of the format to use. The length is the approximate size of the formatted string. <br> - "short": use a short representation of the time. This is the most compact format possible for the locale."<br> - "medium": use a medium length representation of the time. This is a slightly longer format. <br> - "long": use a long representation of the time. This is a fully specified format, but some of the textual components may still be abbreviated <br> - "full": use a full representation of the time. This is a fully specified format where all the textual components are spelled out completely <br><br> Note that the length parameter does not specify which components are to be formatted. Use the "date" and the "time" properties to specify the components.<br> Also, very few of the components of a time format differ according to the length, so this property has little to no effect on time formatting.|
|_\<String?>_ timezone| Time zone to use when formatting times. <br>This may be a time zone instance or a time zone specifier from the IANA list of time zone database names (eg. "America/Los_Angeles"), <br>the string "local", or a string specifying the offset in RFC 822 format. |
|_\<String?>_ calendar|The type of calendar to use for this format. <br> The value should be a string containing the name of the calendar. <br> the supported types are "gregorian", "julian", "persian", "ethiopic", "thaisolar", "arabic", "hebrew", or "chinese". <br> If the calendar is not specified, then the default calendar for the locale is used.|
|_\<String?>_ date| This property tells which components of a date format to use. <br> For example, sometimes you may wish to format a date that only contains the month and date without the year, such as when displaying a person's yearly birthday. <br>The value of this property allows you to specify only those components you want to see in the final output, ordered correctly for the locale. <br> Valid values are: "dmwy", "dmy", "dmw", "dm", "my", "dw", "d", "m","n","y" <br> Default components, if this property is not specified, is "dmy".|
|_\<String?>_ time|This property gives which components of a time format to use.<br> The time will be formatted correctly for the locale with only the time components requested. <br>For example, a clock might only display the hour and minute and not need the seconds or the am/pm component. In this case, the time property should be set to "hm".<br> Valid values for this property are: "ahmsz", "ahms", "hmsz", "hms", "ahmz", "ahm", hmz", ah", "hm", "ms", "h", "m", "s" <br> Default value if this property is not specified is "hma". |
|_\<bool?>_ useNative|The flag used to determine whether to use the native script settings for formatting the numbers.|
|_\<String?>_ meridiems|String that specifies what style of meridiems to use with this format. The choices are "default", "gregorian", "ethiopic", and "chinese".|
